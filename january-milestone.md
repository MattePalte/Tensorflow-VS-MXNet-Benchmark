## Presentation: 20 min

Very brief intro to deep network - 2 min

Big Picture
3 min - tensor and mxnet. linear algebra for DL
Find original paper (vision paper). WHat's the overall architectecutre of the system (tf -> DAG). Mxnet (parameter severs style?). Which scheduling do they do

4 min - Api differences -> comparison
4 min -> benchmarking results -> What we have done 

5 min what is the plan -> digging deeper into system
more complex network (Recurrent?)

## Next steps 
1. Read first paper of MXNet and Tensorflow
1. Capture the result of LeNet -> 6 million different verion of mnist (data augmentation is also possible)

1. Explore low level linear algebra (do some benchmarking)

## Additional notes
Try running differnet ways of dot product -> emprical result which api is better (random matrices, dot product)

Benchmark code-> for normal users like me 

Show two lenet
